# Hotel-Cancellation-Analysis
This repository contains the code and data for a data analysis project that focuses on hotel booking cancellations. The project aims to analyze the factors that contribute to high cancellation rates at two hotels, City Hotel and Resort Hotel. The analysis will help to identify strategies to reduce cancellations and improve revenueÂ generation.


## Project Structure
This repository is organized into the following folders:
 * data: This folder contains the raw hotel booking data used for analysis.
 * notebooks: This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
 * analysis: This folder contains any additional scripts or outputs related to the analysis, such as visualizations or reports.
 * requirements.txt: This file lists the Python libraries required to run the notebooks.

## Project Overview
The notebooks in this repository follow a typical data analysis workflow:
 * Data Exploration and Cleaning: The initial notebooks explore the data, identify missing values and outliers, and clean the data for further analysis.
 * Feature Engineering: New features are created from existing data to improve model performance.
 * Model Building: Different models are trained and evaluated to predict hotel booking cancellations.
 * Evaluation: The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
 * Insights and Recommendations: Based on the analysis, key factors contributing to cancellations are identified, and recommendations for reducing cancellations are developed.
   
## Getting Started
